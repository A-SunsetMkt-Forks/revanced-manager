# 💁 Overview

Take a quick peak of how ReVanced Compose works.

## ⚙️ Technology

We use [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) to 
build beautiful and performant user interfaces using declarative programming. 
It provides a unified and efficient way of building UI that is well-integrated with the Android framework. 

## 📂 Structure

We structure our code to use [MVVM architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) for easier maintenance of the code. 

## 🧑‍💻 Code readability

In order to maintain readability of the code, It's highly recommend that you follow 
https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/api-guidelines style guide to maintain
consistent style through out the codebase. 

## 🎨 Design language

We adopt the [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io) as our design language to 
bring friendly, intuitive and colourful UI to our application ensuring that the 
app's user interface is consistent, customizable, accessible, and engaging for our users.
